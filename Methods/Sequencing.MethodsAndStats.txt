Summary of nanopore methods:

Sample libraries were prepared using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) Native Barcoding
Kit 24 V14 (SQK-NBD114.24) to manufacturer’s specifications. The sample was run on
Nanopore R10.4.1 flow cells on a MinION sequencer. ONT’s Guppy (v6.4.6) was
used to demultiplex samples [1]. Samples were demultiplexed using Guppy’s Super Accurate
basecalling model (dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_modbases_5mc_cg_sup.cfg).

Summary of Illumina (Short-read methods):

Sample libraries were prepared using the Illumina DNA Prep kit (includes
fragmentation) and IDT 10bp UDI indices, and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 2000, producing 2x151bp reads.

QC and Trimming Info (Both Nanopore & Illumina):

Quality control and adapter trimming was performed with bcl-convert [1] and porechop[2] for Illumina and ONT sequencing respectively.
